  The advancement of artificial intelligence is undeniably expanding and changing the technology landscape as it evolves and develops the world in fields that were formerly thought to only
  be within the reach of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is being used in practically every field today, including finance, the economy, healthcare, education, and many more. 
  Given how deeply ingrained it is in certain societies and their institutions, does this mean that it has the potential to help the process of fixing those same broken institutions for developing countries?
  The possible application of artificial intelligence to help rebuild is critically examined in this article and I assess how much AI can advance a country's socioeconomic development by providing information
  on, healthcare, finances and agriculture. This article highlights possible applications of AI to solve and help current issues While some proposed solutions may not be long-term, they can serve as immediate remedies.
  The solutions presented require investment and funding: however, they excel in revitalizing failing institutions. In my following analysis, I examine the many ways that AI technology might advance nation-building initiatives.
  While acknowledging that AI is only attempting to complement human efforts rather than replacing them.

<h3 id="Introduction">Absract</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
 Currently, we’re experiencing rapid technological advancements, and throughout the years the power and skills of technology permeated various institutions, developing their capabilities. We witness many thriving countries 
 succeeding in the technological races and offering their people a more modern and far more advanced lifestyle. This makes me wonder if technology, and AI specifically, could become a catalyst for both the growth and the 
 rebuilding of a country from its broken foundation. When addressing the concept of broken countries, I specifically focus on countries that do not struggle with ongoing conflicts or large-scale humanitarian crises. Such 
 situations often require human aid and international interventions, which I don’t believe AI can effectively address. Instead, the countries I am highlighting mainly struggle with political and economic instability, high rates of poverty and more.

<h3 id="The Education System">The Education System</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
   In countries like the UK and the USA, we can see that AI has become increasingly integrated in various parts of the education system bringing about significant transformations. Artificial intelligence in education (AIED) includes 
   everything from AI-driven step-by-step personalised instructional and dialogue systems, AI-supported exploratory learning, the analysis of student writing and more, all of which firmly places students in control of their learning (Homles et al,2023). 
   Conversely, developing countries with struggling education systems, face challenges such as the fact that although there's access to it around the country there is a lack of quality and not all education is equal (Schmelkes,2020). For example, schools
   in Haiti generally do not have the resources to provide a good education with overcrowded classrooms, untrained teachers and a lack of supplies making it difficult to learn (The Power of Education Foundation, no date). However, with the help of AI, it
   could quickly assist the struggles faced. These solutions vary from creating assistance for teachers by automating training tasks allowing quick access to teacher training materials and facilitating the learning process to tackle the number of unqualified staff. 
   In addition, AI can enhance the accessibility of education through AI virtual schooling that provides access to educational material in isolated and underprivileged areas, these AI-powered online platforms can connect with students in places where traditional educational 
   infrastructure could be poor.
