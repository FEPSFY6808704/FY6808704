  The advancement of artificial intelligence is undeniably expanding and changing the technology landscape as it evolves and develops the world in fields 
  that were formerly thought to only be within the reach of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is being used in practically every field today,
  including finance, the economy, healthcare, education, and many more.Given how deeply ingrained it is in certain societies and their institutions, 
  does this mean that it has the potential to help the process of fixing those same broken institutions for developing countries? The possible application
   of artificial intelligence to help rebuild is critically examined in this article and I assess how much AI can advance a country's socioeconomic development
  by providing information on healthcare, finances and agriculture. This article highlights possible applications of AI to solve and help current issues 
  While some proposed solutions may not be long-term, they can serve as immediate remedies.The solutions presented require investment and funding: however,
  they excel in revitalizing failing institutions. In my following analysis, I examine the many ways that AI technology might advance nation-building initiatives.
  While acknowledging that AI is only attempting to complement human efforts rather than replacing them.

<h3 id="Introduction">Absract</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
 Currently, we’re experiencing rapid technological advancements, and throughout the years the power and skills of technology permeated various institutions,
 developing their capabilities. We witness many thriving countries succeeding in the technological races and offering their people a more modern and far more advanced lifestyle.
This makes me wonder if technology, and AI specifically, could become a catalyst for both the growth and the rebuilding of a country from its broken foundation.
 When addressing the concept of broken countries, I specifically focus on countries that do not struggle with ongoing conflicts or large-scale humanitarian crises. Such 
 situations often require human aid and international interventions, which I don’t believe AI can effectively address. Instead, the countries I am highlighting mainly 
 struggle with political and economic instability, high rates of poverty and more.

<h3 id="The Education System">The Education System</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
   In countries like the UK and the USA, we can see that AI has become increasingly integrated in various parts of the education system bringing about significant transformations.
   Artificial intelligence in education (AIED) includes everything from AI-driven step-by-step personalised instructional and dialogue systems, AI-supported exploratory learning,
  the analysis of student writing and more, all of which firmly places students in control of their learning '(Homles et al,2023). Conversely, developing countries with struggling
   education systems face challenges such as the fact that although there's access to it around the country there is a lack of quality and not all education is equal '<a href="https://www.un.org/pt/node/121488"> (Schmelkes,2020).</a>
   For example, schools in Haiti generally do not have the resources to provide a good education with overcrowded classrooms, untrained teachers and a lack of supplies making it 
   difficult to learn (The Power of Education Foundation, no date). However, with the help of AI, it could quickly assist the struggles faced. These solutions vary from creating 
   assistance for teachers by automating training tasks allowing quick access to teacher training materials and facilitating the learning process to tackle the number of unqualified staff. 
   In addition, AI can enhance the accessibility of education through AI virtual schooling that provides access to educational material in isolated and underprivileged areas, 
   these AI-powered online platforms can connect with students in places where traditional educational 
   infrastructure could be poor.

<h3 id="The Healthcare System">The Healthcare System</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
Similarly, in healthcare, we have witnessed the growth of AI-based devices that assist doctors in effectively diagnosing and treating illnesses e.g. robotic-assisted surgeries. 
The development of medical artificial intelligence is intended to help doctors formulate a diagnosis,make therapeutic decisions and form predictions of outcomes, being successful
over the years (Ramesh et al,2004). AI has also completed tasks in institutions like billing, scheduling and resource application. Sadly, developing countries struggle and suffer 
from cheaply preventable or easily manageable illnesses such as tuberculosis, HIV and diarrhoea (Wiblin, 2016). A lack of knowledge about illness prevention methods leads to 
uninformed approaches when treating, often resulting in fatalities. Cost-effective solutions that could be introduced to these countries include AI models that analyse large datasets
to predict disease outbreaks. This could significantly enhance healthcare systems' ability to respond more effectively to infectious diseases. Given the limited resources for prevention care,
the utilisation of AI applications to identify at-risk populations could facilitate targeted interventions to those regions to allocate the already limited healthcare resources. 
Lastly, another worthwhile investment could be AI-based chatbots and virtual assistants that act as access bridges to provide health education in rural areas.

<h3 id="AI promoting Financial Growth">AI promoting Financial Growth</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
Many developing countries face financial instability due to high levels of debt, limited access to global markets unequal trade agreements and all hindering their ability to provide and be the best.
The figure highlights the increase in public debt skyrocketing over the past few years with developing countries in the league (United Nations,2023). Widespread corruption in some results in the
misallocation of funds intended for developing critical infrastructures. Lebanon had their financial system unravelled in 2019 after decades of mismanagement and corruption (Reuters, 2023). 
‘The national debt in Lebanon has reached an all-time peak of $103.54 billion U.S. dollars’ (O'Neill, 2023). AI could provide financial inclusion by enhancing digital financial services and the damaged
financial infrastructure.AI-powered fintech solutions can successfully provide secure and accessible banking services, promote financial inclusion and improve overall efficiency in financial transactions.
Countries that have been struggling with financial instability have already been investing in fintech with Nigeria having various Fintech companies rising in the fintech’s digital investment market and over 
the past 8 years created a profit of $204 million U.S. dollars (PWC, 2020).Additionally, generative AI could also offer debt management services, by analysing past data and all factors contributing to debt.
This could help governments make well-informed decisions about managing and reconstructing debt. Introducing generative AI with advanced algorithms and machine learning to countries facing
debt challenges could transform how they approach debt management as it has successfully in the USA. (Fernandes, 2023).

<h3 id="AI Solutions for Agriculture Development">AI Solutions for Agricultural Development</h3>
   <p>
      <pre>
Developing countries often grapple with poor agriculture and food insecurity due to a combination of social, economic and environmental factors (United Nations, 2023).  Due to limited access to modern agricultural
technologies, quality seeds and fertilisers all are hindering agricultural productivity(Ariga et al,2019).In developing countries with generally inadequate education systems, there’s mostly a lack of knowledge of
farming practices which often leads to a greater amount of land degradation compared to developed countries which reduces the fertility of soil making it difficult to sustain agriculture (Malik, Nazli,1999).
Investing in AI-powered technology, like drones and sensors that utilise machine learning and computer vision algorithms, farmers can access real-time data on crop health, and soil quality improving the understanding 
of agricultural practices through the analysis of the satellite images produced (CB Insight, 2017).Introducing virtual assissted apps and platforms for uninformed farmers could offer constant assistance on crop management,
market prices and the best practices to help them make informed decisions and improve farming techniques.
