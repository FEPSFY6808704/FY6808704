   The advancement of artificial intelligence is undeniably expanding and changing the technology landscape.
    AI systems are advancing and developing the world in fields that were formerly thought to be only within the reach of human intelligence.
    As a result, AI is having an impact on a wide range of sectors in addition to the technology field, such as the financial industry,
    the healthcare system, and even the creative industries including fashion. As AI's societal impact and creative potential increase, 
    human-AI cooperation and interdependence will become increasingly important to how we live our lives today and in the future.
    The article focuses on how artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing in our lives and considers whether this is beneficial or bad for society.
