  The advancement of artificial intelligence is undeniably expanding and changing the technology landscape
  as it begins evolving and developing the world in fields that were formerly thought to only be within 
  the reach of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is being used in practically every field today,
  including finance, the economy, healthcare, education, and many more. Given how deeply ingrained AI is in 
  society and its institutions, does this mean that it has the potential to excel the process of rebuilding
  these institutions from the ground up and serve as a tool for mending broken nations? The possible application
  of artificial intelligence to nation-building is critically examined in this article, focusing on developing countries,
  I assess how much AI can advance a country's socioeconomic development by providing information on infrastructure,
  healthcare,education, and agriculture. My article will highlight the potential benefits and investigate the challenges 
  and considerations providing a nuanced perspective on the topic.
